Common structure of variable operator is as follows:\n\nvar smth [\"name\",argument]\n\nwhere \"var smth\" is the desired operator, \"name\" is the name of variable it acts on, \"argument\" is the number or the name of other variable which value is taken for calculation.\n   Please note, that every variable name should have quotation-marks.
